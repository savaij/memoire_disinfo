# Evons – Disinformation detection & Virality prediction

This repository contains notebook experiments on the Evons news dataset, centered on two supervised tasks:

1. Disinformation Detection: Classify news items as fake vs real.
2. Virality Prediction: Predict whether an item will become highly engaged (viral) based on a threshold over Facebook engagement statistics.

## Data Representation
Each item in Evons dataset is formed by a title and a caption. Information on the source are also included.


## Model families

All experiments use lightweight feed‑forward (MLP) classifiers over frozen (precomputed) text embeddings (e.g., RoBERTa CLS vectors or alternative large-model embeddings). Variants differ only in what auxiliary source/context signal they add (none, per‑source statistics, gating fusion, or learned source embeddings).
