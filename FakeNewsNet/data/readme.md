# Data

All code expects the data to be stored in this folder. Due to their large size and Twitter/X privacy regulations, it is not possible to upload them directly to GitHub. Below are the instructions to download either the raw or pre-processed data.  

- **Raw data**: contact the author to obtain them  
- **Processed data** (filtered tweet sequences and textual embeddings): downloadable [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16UfhZw9lDhTjWKLL7kXCm9U4YU0uURV6?usp=sharing) (authorization required)  

The data comes from the *Politifact* subfolder of the FakeNewsNet dataset, whose original repository is [available here](https://github.com/KaiDMML/FakeNewsNet).
