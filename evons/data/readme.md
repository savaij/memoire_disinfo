# Evons data - download instructions

Codes expect data to be in this folder.

Due to the large size of the data, it was not possible to upload it directly to GitHub. Below are instructions for downloading it from other hosts:

- The complete Evons dataset in CSV format can be downloaded following curators' instructions here: https://github.com/krstovski/evons

- precomputed embeddings can be accessed by [clicking here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1X27WjPEKzAcC5jXai8cuI8FEmWkjJb6l?usp=sharing).
